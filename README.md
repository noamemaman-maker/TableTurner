## 💡 Overview

### The Problem
Restaurants often depend on manual or verbal estimates for wait times — a system that’s unreliable and inconsistent.  
This leads to:
- Frustrated guests due to inaccurate wait times  
- Underused tables and miscommunication between staff  
- Lost revenue when customers walk away  

### The Solution
TableTurner automates this process by using live occupancy tracking and predictive timing to determine exactly when tables will be ready.  
Guests get accurate, real-time updates while staff receive a streamlined, data-driven system that makes seating and coordination effortless.
